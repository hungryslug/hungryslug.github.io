My research primarily focuses on the indirect landscape effects of predation on ecosystem engineers. Specifically, I am investigating the landscape impacts of wolf predation on beaver pond creation, re-colonization, and distribution. I am also interested in how predators utilize short term seasonal resource pulses as alternative prey, including how wolves take advantage of freshwater fish during the spawning season. My research is conducted in the Northern Minnesota in collaboration with the Voyageurs Wolf Project.
